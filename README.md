🖥 We're using [python-telegram-bot Package](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/README.rst) to use Telegram-API in python.
And also [tradingview-ta](https://python-tradingview-ta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to download data from [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/).
Remember to place your own 'Telegram-API-Token'. 
📖 We recommend saving your API-KEYs in a safe *.env* environment.

# 2 Important Notes
1. Remember, You NEED To Place Your Own Telegram-Bot-API On Line 26
2. Also, You NEED To Place Your Own Channel User-Id on Line 234. It's Not Your Channel's Username And It Does Not Start With @.
It's Something Like This: -1111111111111. You Can Get It Using [IDBot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot); That Bot Is Not Mine By The Way.
